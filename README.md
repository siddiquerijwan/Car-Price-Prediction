ðŸš— Car Price Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Car Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a car based on various features like brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, and more. This project is ideal for learning regression techniques and deploying ML models in real-world scenarios.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains historical data of used cars, with features including:

Car_Name

Year

Selling_Price

Present_Price

Kms_Driven

Fuel_Type

Seller_Type

Transmission

Owner

You can use a dataset from Kaggle like Used Cars Dataset or any similar car dataset.
